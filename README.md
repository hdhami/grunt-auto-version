# grunt-auto-version
This is a grunt plugin and can automate the versioning of any file (be it .html/.css/.js/.scss/.php etc type)  and backs-up the current modified files. This has hard dependency on Git. So if you are using Git as your SCM tool, it is good to use to automate file versioning. It is very useful in case of static files (e.g .css/ .js /.scss) where files are versioned very frequently with every release, because it ensures a unique version of a modified file goes to the production environment which in turn ensures caching issues of those modified files on CDN servers will be minimized.
